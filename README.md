# Analysis of Global Flight Delays and Cancellations

## Welcome to my Data portfolio! 
My first data analysis project aims to analyze and visualize patterns, causes, and impacts
of flight delays and cancellations across different airports and airlines worldwide. 
Using data analytics and visualization techniques, I will uncover insights into flight 
performance and provide a comprehensive overview of the factors affecting flight delays. 

This project is currently under progress, but I would be glad for your feedback!
